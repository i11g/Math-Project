    "For the Genetic Algorithm, we are evolving a population of candidates(binary vectors of length n) over many generations using selection, crossover, mutation and elitism. We start by defining a fitness function that calculates the total value of a candidates and assign a fitness of 0 to any overweight solution, so only valid packings compete. The initial population is created randomly and each individual is a random 0/1 string with length n.The goal is that starting randomly, GA can exploire many regions of the solution space. Next we create the slection function in which we choose a tournamet as a way to select memebers, becouse that type of selection balances selective pressure (favoring better solutions) with genetic diversity (random sampling). We randomlyy pick the tournament_size members and then take the fittest among them. As a next step we create the crossover function with a single-point crossover at random cut. The crossover function main goal is to create a $n$ offsprings which may inherits good subset of items form their parents. We also create the mutation function, whcih flips each bit with a small probability with the main objective to inject a new genetic material to avoid premature convergence and explore unseen packings.

    " items) and the total runtime is \n",

Much like our earlier experiments that varied the number of items, we define a function called benchmark_varying_capacity(ns, capacity_factors, repeats, ga_params) which, for each combination of number of items \n",

    ", its runtime goes up almost linearly in the capacity factor. Likewise, when \n",
    " goes from 200 → 300 → 500, the DP runtime also scales up linearly in \n",
    ". On the other hand, a typical GA‐based solver fixes a population size and number of generations up front (e.g. 100 chromosomes × 200 generations). Evaluating the fitness of one candidate solution is an \n",
    " operation, but it does not depend on \n",
    " itself. As a result, changing the capacity factor hardly moves the GA’s “mean time” at all. That is why all three GA curves (n=200, n=300, n=500) sit almost flat from 0.25→0.50→0.75. At small \n",
    " and small capacity (e.g. n=200, cap=0.25), DP is actually faster (≈0.4 s) than GA (≈0.9 s), because the DP table (200×W) is still tiny. As capacity grows (say n=200→cap=0.75), DP’s table becomes much larger (200×(0.75·sum‐of‐weights) vs. 200×(0.25·sum‐of‐weights)), so DP time climbs to ≈1.3 s. GA, by contrast, is still about 0.7–0.9 s. Once n is large (e.g. n=500), DP is doing a 500 × W table; even at cap=0.25 it’s already ≈2.7 s, and by cap=0.75 it’s ≈8.5 s. Meanwhile GA for n=500 stays around ≈0.8–1.0 s no matter what the capacity factor is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, DP’s runtime grows linearly in both n and W, while GA’s runtime grows only in n (and in practice very mildly), and is essentially independent of the knapsack‐capacity parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you also see that at small problem sizes and small capacities, DP can be faster, but once n or W becomes large, DP’s runtime explodes—whereas the GA runtime remains roughly constant.\n",

    "4.2.2.2 Solution Quality\n",
    "The results of our experiments on the solution quality are not very consistent, but the general trends which we observe are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "GA’s quality degrades as the number of items grows (for most capacity factors).\n",
    "GA tends to do best (relative to DP) when the capacity factor is “in the middle” (around 0.50), especially for moderate‐sized n. In a “medium” capacity regime (about half the total weight), there are often many nearly‐optimal ways to fill the knapsack, so the GA can “stumble” onto one of those pretty easily. In other words, there is more combinatorial slack (more good‐enough subsets), and the GA’s randomness/exploration has a higher chance of landing near the optimum."
