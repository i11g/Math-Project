    "For the Genetic Algorithm, we are evolving a population of candidates(binary vectors of length n) over many generations using selection, crossover, mutation and elitism. We start by defining a fitness function that calculates the total value of a candidates and assign a fitness of 0 to any overweight solution, so only valid packings compete. The initial population is created randomly and each individual is a random 0/1 string with length n.The goal is that starting randomly, GA can exploire many regions of the solution space. Next we create the slection function in which we choose a tournamet as a way to select memebers, becouse that type of selection balances selective pressure (favoring better solutions) with genetic diversity (random sampling). We randomlyy pick the tournament_size members and then take the fittest among them. As a next step we create the crossover function with a single-point crossover at random cut. The crossover function main goal is to create a $n$ offsprings which may inherits good subset of items form their parents. We also create the mutation function, whcih flips each bit with a small probability with the main objective to inject a new genetic material to avoid premature convergence and explore unseen packings. And as a last step we run the main loop in which we\n",
